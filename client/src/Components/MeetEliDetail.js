        After struggling with years of health issues, including reaching 288
        pounds, undergoing a kidney transplant, and suffering a heart attack at
        the young age of 45, I knew I needed to make a radical change. That's
        when I adopted a whole food, plant-based lifestyle. By removing
        processed foods and animal proteins and focusing on natural,
        nutrient-dense fruits, vegetables, grains and legumes, I lost 64 pounds
        and brought all of my health numbers into normal ranges in just a few
        short months.

        My transformation sparked in me a passion for helping others take
        control of their health. I want to provide the knowledge and tools for
        people to prevent and even reverse disease through diet and lifestyle
        changes. I offer one-on-one guidance to track biomarkers and tangible
        proof that what we eat matters. Diets centered around plants can empower
        us and future generations to lead vibrant, healthy lives while also
        preserving our planet.{" "}
